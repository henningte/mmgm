Description: Provides a mixing model for \eqn{\gamma_\text{MIRS}} bulk estimates 
    (the degree of decomposition, \eqn{\gamma} estimated from mid infrared 
    spectra) of peat samples. The mixing model takes \eqn{\gamma_\text{MIRS}} 
    and the mass fractions of each component of the sample as input and 
    estimates \eqn{\gamma} of each component and of the entire sample. Batch 
    processing is possible.
